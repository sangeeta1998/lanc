**Primary Research Question:**
*How can we provide continuous security assurance and incident response in ultra-large scale distributed systems where traditional security-by-design approaches fail due to compositional complexity and the presence of compromised elements?*

**Problem Context:**
The SCULI project addresses the paradigm shift from "security-by-design" to "securing-a-compromised-system" in ultra-large scale infrastructures. This experiment demonstrates a novel approach to this challenge through:

1. **Compositional Security**: Cross-system security policy composition
2. **Runtime Assurance**: Continuous security monitoring without complete system knowledge
3. **Incident Response**: Automated response orchestration in distributed systems
4. **Threat Prediction**: ML-based proactive security measures
