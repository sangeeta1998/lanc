# ðŸŽ¯ SCULI Alignment Documentation

## Overview

This trust monitoring system is specifically designed to address SCULI's four core research objectives in the context of large distributed systems. Each component directly maps to one of SCULI's objectives, providing a comprehensive solution for trust assessment and security assurance.

## ðŸ”® Predictability: Forecasting Security State

### SCULI Objective
> "Can we forecast the security state (Trust Score) based on current evidence?"

### Implementation

Our **Predictability Engine** provides advanced forecasting capabilities:

#### Key Features
- **Historical Data Analysis**: Machine learning models trained on security event patterns
- **Probabilistic Modeling**: Bayesian networks for trust decay prediction  
- **Risk Forecasting**: Early warning systems for potential security breaches
- **Anomaly Detection**: Real-time identification of unusual system behaviors

#### Technical Implementation
```rust
// LSTM-based trust prediction model
pub struct LSTMTrustModel {
    model_weights: Array2<f64>,
    hidden_size: usize,
    sequence_length: usize,
}

// Bayesian network propagation model
pub struct BayesianPropagationModel {
    conditional_probabilities: HashMap<String, f64>,
}
```

#### SCULI Alignment
- **Historical Evidence**: Uses past security events, performance metrics, and behavioral patterns
- **Probabilistic Forecasting**: Provides confidence intervals and risk factor analysis
- **Early Warning**: Identifies potential trust degradation before it becomes critical
- **Adaptive Learning**: Models continuously improve based on new evidence

### Expected Outcomes
- **Prediction Accuracy**: >90% for known patterns, >75% for novel threats
- **Early Warning Time**: 15-30 minutes advance notice of trust degradation
- **False Positive Rate**: <3% for behavioral analysis

## ðŸ§© Composition: System-of-Systems Trust Propagation

### SCULI Objective
> "Trust must be assessed for the whole system, which is composed of many parts (a.k.a. system-of-systems)."

### Implementation

Our **Composition Engine** handles complex trust propagation across distributed systems:

#### Key Features
- **Trust Graph Modeling**: Mathematical representation of component relationships
- **Trust Propagation Algorithms**: How trust flows through interconnected systems
- **Compositional Analysis**: Assessing overall system trust from individual components
- **Dependency Mapping**: Understanding how low-trust components affect high-trust systems

#### Technical Implementation
```rust
// Trust graph for system-of-systems modeling
pub struct TrustGraph {
    pub nodes: HashMap<String, TrustNode>,
    pub edges: HashMap<String, TrustEdge>,
    pub dependencies: HashMap<String, Vec<String>>,
}

// Multiple propagation models
pub struct WeightedAverageModel;
pub struct MinimumTrustModel;
pub struct BayesianPropagationModel;
```

#### SCULI Alignment
- **System Composition**: Models entire distributed system as interconnected components
- **Trust Propagation**: Mathematical frameworks for how trust flows through dependencies
- **Compositional Rules**: Clear rules for how component trust affects system trust
- **Dependency Analysis**: Identifies critical paths and weak links in the system

### Expected Outcomes
- **Compositional Accuracy**: >85% accuracy in system-of-systems trust assessment
- **Dependency Mapping**: Complete visibility into component relationships
- **Critical Path Identification**: Automated detection of system bottlenecks

## âš¡ Continual Assurance: Real-time Dynamic Monitoring

### SCULI Objective
> "Security isn't a one-time check; it's an ongoing, runtime process."

### Implementation

Our **Continual Assurance Engine** provides real-time, dynamic trust monitoring:

#### Key Features

- **Dynamic Trust Scoring**: Continuous updates based on current system state
- **Adaptive Thresholds**: Self-adjusting security parameters based on system behavior
- **Multi-Source Integration**: Combining data from various monitoring tools

#### Technical Implementation
```rust
// Real-time trust calculation
pub struct ContinualAssuranceEngine {
    pub component_registry: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, ComponentMonitor>>>,
    pub trust_calculators: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Box<dyn TrustCalculator>>>>,
    pub data_sources: Arc<RwLock<Vec<Box<dyn DataSource>>>>,
}

// Multiple trust calculation methods
pub struct WeightedAverageCalculator;
pub struct MLTrustCalculator;
```

#### SCULI Alignment
- **Runtime Monitoring**: Continuous assessment of system security state
- **Dynamic Updates**: Trust scores update in real-time based on current evidence
- **Streaming Data**: Processes high-volume observability data streams
- **Adaptive Behavior**: System learns and adapts to changing conditions

### Expected Outcomes
- **Update Frequency**: Trust scores updated every 30 seconds
- **Data Processing**: Handle 10,000+ metrics per second
- **Response Time**: <50ms for automated responses
- **System Resilience**: Maintain >95% functionality under attack

## ðŸš¨ Incident Response: Adaptive Action Orchestration

### SCULI Objective
> "The monitoring system must quickly and accurately inform the response to a breach."

### Implementation

Our **Incident Response Engine** provides intelligent, automated response orchestration:

#### Key Features
- **Automated Response**: Direct triggering of security actions based on trust scores
- **Orchestration Engine**: Coordinating responses across distributed systems
- **Escalation Policies**: Intelligent escalation based on trust degradation patterns
- **Recovery Automation**: Automated system recovery and trust restoration

#### Technical Implementation
```rust
// Incident response orchestration
pub struct IncidentResponseEngine {
    pub response_policies: Arc<RwLock<Vec<ResponsePolicy>>>,
    pub active_incidents: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Incident>>>,
    pub action_executors: Arc<RwLock<HashMap<String, Box<dyn ActionExecutor>>>>,
}

// Multiple action executors
pub struct IsolationExecutor;
pub struct ScalingExecutor;
pub struct ConfigurationExecutor;
pub struct WorkflowExecutor;
```

#### SCULI Alignment
- **Direct Action Triggering**: Trust scores directly trigger automated responses
- **Orchestrated Response**: Coordinates actions across multiple system components
