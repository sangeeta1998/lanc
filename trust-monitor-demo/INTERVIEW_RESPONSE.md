# Interview Response: Trust Assessment in Large Distributed Systems
## SCULI Interview - Research Proposal & Demonstration

### 🎯 **Opening Statement (2 minutes)**

> *"I'd like to present a research proposal that addresses SCULI's core challenge: how to provide trust assessment in ultra-large scale systems where traditional security-by-design approaches fail. My approach combines theoretical rigor with practical implementation, and I have a working prototype to demonstrate the concept."*

---

### 🔬 **Problem Scoping & Research Question (3 minutes)**

#### **The Core Challenge**
Traditional security approaches assume trusted components and complete system knowledge. However, in ultra-large scale distributed systems like those SCULI targets, we face:

- **Compositional Complexity**: Heterogeneous components assemble dynamically
- **Partial Information**: Complete system knowledge is impossible
- **Compromised Elements**: Systems operate with untrusted/compromised components
- **Scale**: Millions of components across diverse architectures

#### **Research Question**
*How can we provide continuous trust assessment and assurance in ultra-large scale distributed systems where traditional security-by-design approaches fail due to compositional complexity and the presence of compromised elements?*

#### **Sub-Research Questions**
1. **Compositional Trust**: How do trust properties compose across heterogeneous components?
2. **Runtime Assurance**: What metrics enable real-time trust assessment without complete knowledge?
3. **Scalability**: How can trust assessment scale to millions of components?
4. **Uncertainty Handling**: How do we reason about trust with partial information?

### 🧪 **Research Methodology & Experimental Design (4 minutes)**

#### **Three-Phase Approach**

**Phase 1: Trust Model Development (Months 1-6)**
- **Hypothesis**: Trust can be modeled as multi-dimensional, compositional property
- **Approach**: 
  - Literature survey and gap analysis
  - Design multi-dimensional trust metrics (integrity, behavior, communication, provenance)
  - Formal verification of trust composition properties
- **Expected Outcome**: Novel trust model with theoretical validation

**Phase 2: Prototype Implementation (Months 7-12)**
- **Hypothesis**: WebAssembly-based trust agents provide portable, lightweight assessment
- **Approach**:
  - Implement trust agents in Rust/WebAssembly
  - Integrate with container orchestration systems
  - Validate across ARM64, RISC-V, x86_64 architectures
- **Expected Outcome**: Working prototype with performance benchmarks

**Phase 3: Real-World Validation (Months 13-18)**
- **Hypothesis**: Approach provides practical trust assessment in real systems
- **Approach**:
  - Deploy in smart city and industrial IoT case studies
  - Monitor real-world trust dynamics
  - Compare with existing security monitoring
- **Expected Outcome**: Empirical validation and deployment guidelines

#### **Specific Experiments**

**Experiment 1: Trust Composition Validation**
- Deploy testbed with known trust levels
- Measure trust propagation through component interactions
- Validate theoretical predictions

**Experiment 2: Scalability Analysis**
- Deploy across varying scales (100, 1000, 10000 nodes)
- Measure latency and resource consumption
- Analyze trust propagation dynamics

**Experiment 3: Compromise Detection**
- Inject known compromises
- Measure response time and accuracy
- Analyze false positive rates

**Experiment 4: Cross-Architecture Portability**
- Deploy identical agents on ARM64, RISC-V, x86_64
- Measure performance consistency
- Validate accuracy across platforms
