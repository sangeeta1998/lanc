## ðŸ“Š **Expected Interview Questions & Answers**

### **Q: How does your system handle the complexity of large distributed systems?**
**A**: "My composition engine uses trust graphs to model the entire system as interconnected components. It implements graph-based propagation algorithms to understand how trust flows through dependencies, and identifies critical paths and weak links that could affect the entire system."

### **Q: How do you ensure the trust scores are accurate?**
**A**: "I use Bayesian inference with multiple evidence sources: security events, performance metrics, behavioral anomalies, compliance status, and dependency health. The system provides confidence intervals and continuously validates predictions against actual outcomes."

### **Q: How does your system handle false positives?**
**A**: "I implement adaptive thresholds that learn from system behavior, use ensemble methods to reduce individual model errors, and provide confidence scoring. The system also has escalation policies that prevent over-reaction to temporary anomalies."

### **Q: What makes your approach innovative?**
**A**: "The key innovation is the integration of all four SCULI objectives into a cohesive system. Most existing solutions focus on one aspect - I've created a unified framework that handles prediction, composition, continual monitoring, and automated response in a single system."

### **Q: How would you deploy this in a real organization?**
**A**: "The system is designed for production deployment with WebAssembly, containers, and legacy system integration. It provides comprehensive APIs for customization and integrates with existing monitoring infrastructure."

## ðŸŽ¯ **SCULI-Specific Talking Points**

### **Digital Infrastructure Convergence**
> "My system addresses the convergence of cyber-physical systems by providing unified trust assessment across heterogeneous components - from WebAssembly modules to containers to legacy systems."

### **Supply Chain Complexity**
> "The composition engine specifically handles third-party components and supply chain risks by modeling trust propagation through dependencies and identifying how compromised components affect the entire system."

### **Societal Scale Operations**
> "The system is designed to scale to millions of components and users, with streaming analytics that can process 10,000+ metrics per second and orchestrate responses across distributed infrastructure."

### **Securing Compromised Systems**
> "The incident response engine implements zero-trust principles with automated isolation, recovery, and trust restoration. It can operate in environments where some components are already compromised."
