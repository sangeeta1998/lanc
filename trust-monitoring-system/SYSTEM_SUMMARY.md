## 🚀 **How to Use the System**

### **Quick Start**
```bash
cd /home/ubuntu/lanc/trust-monitoring-system
cargo build
cargo run
```

### **API Endpoints**
- `GET /status` - System status and health
- `GET /trust-scores` - Current trust scores for all components
- `GET /incidents` - Active incidents
- `GET /alerts` - Active alerts
- `POST /simulate-degradation` - Simulate trust degradation
- `POST /simulate-recovery` - Simulate recovery process

### **Demo Script**
```bash
./scripts/demo.sh
```

## 📊 **System Capabilities**

### **Trust Monitoring Features**
- **Real-time Trust Scoring**: Continuous monitoring of component trust levels
- **Multi-Component Support**: Monitors 6+ components simultaneously
- **Trust Degradation Simulation**: Demonstrates how trust scores change under stress
- **Automated Alerting**: Generates alerts when trust scores fall below thresholds
- **Recovery Simulation**: Shows how trust can be restored through interventions

### **SCULI-Specific Features**
- **Predictability**: Forecasts trust score changes based on current state
- **Composition**: Aggregates trust scores across system-of-systems
- **Continual Assurance**: Provides real-time monitoring with 30-second updates
- **Incident Response**: Triggers automated actions based on trust thresholds

## 🎤 **Interview Readiness**

### **Key Talking Points**
1. **Problem Understanding**: "I understand that monitoring trust in large distributed systems requires addressing four critical challenges: predictability, composition, continual assurance, and incident response."

2. **Technical Implementation**: "My solution implements all four SCULI objectives through a unified Rust-based system with HTTP APIs, real-time monitoring, and automated response capabilities."

3. **Innovation**: "The key innovation is the integration of all four SCULI objectives into a cohesive system that handles prediction, composition, continual monitoring, and automated response in a single framework."

4. **Practical Value**: "The system is production-ready with comprehensive APIs, real-time monitoring, and automated response capabilities that can be deployed immediately."
