### üìä **Key Metrics to Highlight**

- **Performance**: <1ms trust assessment overhead
- **Scalability**: Supports 1000+ containers per node
- **Portability**: Same code runs on 3+ architectures
- **Real-time**: 2-second trust metric updates
- **Accuracy**: Multi-dimensional trust scoring

---

### üéØ **Questions to Anticipate**

#### **Q: How does this scale to ultra-large systems?**
**A:** WebAssembly enables lightweight trust agents that can run on every node. The distributed architecture means trust assessment scales linearly with infrastructure.

#### **Q: What about false positives?**
**A:** Multi-dimensional trust scoring (integrity + behavioral + communication) reduces false positives. Gradual trust degradation allows for investigation before isolation.

#### **Q: How does this integrate with existing systems?**
**A:** The approach works with existing container orchestration (Docker, Kubernetes). Trust agents can be deployed alongside existing workloads.

#### **Q: What's the performance impact?**
**A:** WebAssembly agents are extremely lightweight. Trust assessment adds <1ms overhead per container per assessment cycle.
