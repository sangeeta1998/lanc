## SCULI Interview Response

### ðŸŽ¯ **Problem Scoping & Research Question**

**Primary Research Question:**
*How can we provide continuous trust assessment and assurance in ultra-large scale distributed systems where traditional security-by-design approaches fail due to compositional complexity and the presence of compromised elements?*

**Sub-Research Questions:**
1. **Compositional Trust**: How do trust properties compose across heterogeneous, dynamically assembled components?
2. **Runtime Assurance**: What metrics and mechanisms enable real-time trust assessment without complete system knowledge?
3. **Scalability**: How can trust assessment scale to millions of components across diverse architectures?
4. **Uncertainty Handling**: How do we reason about trust in the presence of partial information and compromised elements?
