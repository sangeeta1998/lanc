# Interview Response: Securing Compromised Systems at Ultra-Large Scale
## SCULI Interview - Alternative Experiment

### 🎯 **Opening Statement (2 minutes)**

> *"I'd like to present a research proposal that directly addresses SCULI's core challenge: securing compromised systems at ultra-large scale. My approach demonstrates a novel framework for continuous security assurance and incident response in distributed systems, and I have a working prototype to demonstrate the concept."*

### 🔬 **Problem Scoping & Research Question (3 minutes)**

#### **The Core Challenge**
SCULI's research addresses the paradigm shift from "security-by-design" to "securing-a-compromised-system" in ultra-large scale infrastructures. The key challenges are:

- **Compositional Complexity**: Heterogeneous systems assemble dynamically with varying security postures
- **Partial Information**: Complete system knowledge is impossible in ultra-large scale systems
- **Compromised Elements**: Systems must operate with untrusted/compromised components
- **Scale**: Millions of components across diverse architectures and domains

#### **Research Question**
*How can we provide continuous security assurance and incident response in ultra-large scale distributed systems where traditional security-by-design approaches fail due to compositional complexity and the presence of compromised elements?*

#### **Sub-Research Questions**
1. **Compositional Security**: How do security properties compose across heterogeneous systems?
2. **Runtime Assurance**: What metrics enable real-time security assessment without complete knowledge?
3. **Incident Response**: How do we orchestrate automated response across distributed systems?
4. **Threat Prediction**: How can ML-based approaches provide proactive security measures?
